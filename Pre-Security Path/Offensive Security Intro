# Offensive Security Intro (TryHackMe)

## Summary
This room taught me how to access the terminal, input command lines, and scan websites for hidden pages.

## Objectives Completed
- Open the terminal on the VM and scan the website for hidden pages
- Use the hidden admin page to send myself $2000
- Understand how the command line brought about the result and real-world applications

## Tools Used
- Terminal
- Gobuster
- Virtual Machine

## Challenges
- At first, I didn't see the $2000 in my account on the VM and was a little worried.   
- I'd mistyped some letters in the command line.

## Key Takeaways
- I learned how to access the terminal, how to input command lines, troubleshoot, and how to use a VM
- The terminal and VM are probably going to be my best friends from now. Knowing how to access them is a big boon.
